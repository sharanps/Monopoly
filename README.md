###Introduction

Themed slot machines have been a staple of casinos for decades. One such popular theme is the game of Monopoly. Each Monopoly themed slot machine has a bonus round that is triggered by certain symbols showing up on the reels during a spin.

A favorite bonus round of slot machine enthusiasts is the Once Around Bonus. In this bonus, a player token starts at Go and Mr. Monopoly rolls the dice to move the token around the board. Instead of the player paying for properties, taxes, utilities, etc, the game pays the player based on the type of space the player lands on. When the player reaches or passes Go, the bonus round is over and the player collects his winnings.

As part of this project we implement the logic for Once Around Bonus game.
